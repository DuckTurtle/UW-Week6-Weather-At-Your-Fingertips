# UW-Week6-Weather-At-Your-Fingertips

##Discription

This is a website that pulls the weather forcast and and curent weather of the requested town/ city. I created this as a way to bypass news stations 
with all of their ads and pay walls. Now I can find the weather forcast with one search insted of 6. I learned how to call an api, hold my code till the api call is done,
and how to properly pass the results of an api onto another function.

##Instalation
There is no instalation.

##Usage
There is two main features of this app. The first being the search bar where when you type in a valid city name a 6 day forcast is displayed on screen. The second feature
is the history bar that holds previous inquiorys of the weather. Clicking on a object in the history bar pulls up the surched weather. The history is reset every time in 
order to avoid overloading the app, and cluttering the page.
